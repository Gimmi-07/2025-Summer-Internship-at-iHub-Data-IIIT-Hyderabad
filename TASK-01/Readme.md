**Task 1: YOLOv8 Segmentation Test on Online Image**

**Objective**
To verify the YOLOv8 environment setup by performing object detection and segmentation on an image from an online source.

**Tools & Libraries Used**

* Python
* Ultralytics YOLOv8
* Pretrained model: `yolov8n-seg.pt`

**Steps Performed**

1. Installed required dependencies and configured the YOLOv8 environment.
2. Loaded the pretrained YOLOv8 segmentation model.
3. Performed inference on an image from a URL (`bus.jpg`).
4. Saved and displayed the output image with segmentation masks.

**Output**

* The output image contains detected objects with pixel-level segmentation masks.
* Confirms that the YOLOv8 segmentation model is working and the setup is correct.
